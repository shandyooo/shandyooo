- 👋 Hi, I’m @shandyooo (John)
- 👀 I’m interested in Product Design, Interaction Design, Accessibility and Animation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python so I can create games with my son and slowly teach him to code through fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on personal projects. Education and mental health are areas I'm really interested in improving in my spare time (I have many family that teach). Tools and resources to help that would give me gret intrinsic reward.
- 📫 How to reach me: I mainly use LinkedIn as my social channel. For work, I normally live inside community UX Slack Channels (Figma etc)
